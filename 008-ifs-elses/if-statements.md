in Go we have if, else, and else if

the if block check if the codition is true, if it is it will enter the block of code, if not we can create a else if block to check for another condition or we case use just the else to execute the block of code in case the condition is false

```go
if condition {
  fmt.Print("condition 1 was true")
} else if condition2 {
  fmt.Print("condition 1 was false and condition 2 was true")
} else {
  fmt.Print("condition 1 and condition 2 was false")
}
```
